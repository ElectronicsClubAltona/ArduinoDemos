ArduinoDemos
============

This is a collection of programs for the Arduino - some quite small for instruction/teaching.

These have been tested on an Ether Mega or my Red Glove Lilypad hardware.
Source was built on an XUBUNTU laptop using Arduino IDE version 1.6.7 .

The code is experimental and would often change.
